# Banking Management System

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Bank Management System, developed as part of a semester 5 DBMS mini project. This system is designed to replicate the core functionalities of a modern banking system, including managing customer accounts, facilitating transactions, and maintaining secure records.

This document outlines the system's functions, features, interfaces, and objectives, as well as the limitations under which it operates and its expected behavior in response to external interactions. It is intended for system developers and stakeholders, serving as a guide for evaluating the systemâ€™s design, implementation, and functionality within the academic context.

The Bank Management System aims to provide a simplified yet effective solution for managing banking operations within the scope of an educational project. Compared to traditional paper-based banking management, this system demonstrates the advantages of maintaining digital records, which can be accessed and updated seamlessly based on user privileges.

While it does not replicate a full-scale banking solution, the system offers insights into the principles of secure, efficient, and user-friendly banking operations. As online systems become increasingly vital for modern banking, this project serves as a hands-on introduction to building and managing such systems.
